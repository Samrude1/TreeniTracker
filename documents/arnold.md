It’s been more than four decades since Arnold Schwarzenegger won the last of his seven Mr. Olympia titles in 1980, yet the workouts that helped mold him into arguably the greatest bodybuilder ever are as valid today as they were then. From the time he migrated from Munich to Southern California in 1969, right through to his first retirement from professional bodybuilding in 1975 (1980 represented his brief competitive comeback), everything Arnold did revolved around training.

He would train twice a day at Gold’s Gym in Venice, joined by all of his closest friends—bodybuilding icons like the late-Franco Columbu, Frank Zane, and Dave Draper.

His workouts lasted hours, with a seemingly endless number of exercises and sets. It was the epitome of high-volume training, a style of working out criticized by most training experts today as not allowing adequate muscle recovery. But there was a method to Arnold’s madness. In the following slides, you’ll see—body part by body part—the actual workouts the Austrian Oak performed while in the prime of his career, when he was the undisputed king of bodybuilding.

Chest
Trying to describe Arnold’s chest and back routines separately can get a little tricky; he supersetted the two exclusively for most of his bodybuilding career. (For the sake of organization in this article, however, we’ll focus on each body part separately, as each routine can also stand on its own.) Arnold had simple reasons for employing supersets: One, they saved time and allowed him to train chest and back combined in roughly one hour. Two, he felt he could handle more weight this way, and so develop greater muscle density (the same logic behind training opposing muscle groups together). And, of course, three, because he relished the experience.

As he once put it, “When the chest and the upper back”—essentially, his entire upper body—“are pumped simultaneously, there is an indescribable feeling of growth stimulation and massiveness.” But Arnold also warned beginners about this style of training, recommending they work into it slowly because of the demands it places on endurance and stamina. Even seasoned lifters can struggle. Arnold once told a story about introducing his chest/back workout to several experienced bodybuilders while visiting South Africa. According to the Oak, two of his training partners “passed out cold, and a third became so ill he lost his breakfast!”

Training tips
Despite relatively high rep ranges, Arnold went as heavy as he could when training chest to elicit maximal growth. He typically used the pyramid principle, increasing weight and decreasing reps on each set of a given exercise.
He also regularly used straight-arm pullovers in his training, employing either a dumbbell or barbell (despite their exclusion from this routine). Arnold felt that pullovers expanded the thorax and enlarged the rib cage, though this was never proven to be fact.
In addition to supersets, Arnold often performed forced reps, Iso-Tension (holding poses between sets and after workouts), and peak contractions (squeezing the muscles at the top of each rep) in his training. He did whatever it took to increase intensity.

Back
Building a wide, thick, detailed back isn’t a new idea revealed exclusively to modern-day bodybuilders like Ronnie Coleman, Jay Cutler, and Phil Heath. Arnold, Franco Columbu, and others they trained with also knew the importance of the back double-biceps and lat spread poses for winning major competitions. When Arnold trained back, he didn’t just concentrate on lifting the weight to a desired position as other bodybuilders did. After all, he would never be the best at training the way everyone else did. On lat pulldowns, for instance, he attempted to pull the sky down on top of him as opposed to simply moving the bar to his upper chest. When deadlifting, those weren’t weight plates on the ends of the barbell, they were massive planets. The thinking was abstract, sure, but effective nonetheless.

There was one potentially effective visualization technique Arnold didn’t know to use at the time. “Had I been aware of Conan [the Barbarian] during my competition years,” he said in the time leading up to that film, “I probably would have imagined I was him during my workouts.” He was intent on developing his back for the movie because he knew it would be easily visible from many camera angles—and the last thing he wanted was less-than-stellar lats if he was to be a proper barbarian. “I’ll want my back muscles to bristle with power,” he said. “If my back is writhing and rippling during fight scenes, the public will know that I am a rugged fighter.”

Training tips
Arnold felt it was best to train all areas of the back—outer, upper, lower, middle—then finish the workout with a power movement like deadlifts or cleans, which would work all the back muscles.
After each back exercise, Arnold stretched his lats by pulling hard on a stationary object with one or both arms fully extended. This, he believed, helped him achieve great overall lat development and remain flexible and limber in the upper body.
When he wanted to hit the lower lats, Arnold always used a narrow grip on chinups, pulldowns, and any type of row. Lower lat development helped complement the immense width of his upper body.

Shoulders
“A man who has developed wide, broader shoulders feels superior and has a greater sense of security and confidence about him,” Arnold once told a magazine. Not surprisingly, he scoffed at the large number of bodybuilders he knew whose training regimens were absent any sort of shoulder work. No wonder the one exercise named after him, the Arnold Press, is a delt movement.

Early in his bodybuilding career, Arnold’s deltoids were the weakest aspect of his upper body. So he worked them tirelessly, and after winning the 1967 Mr. Universe contest in London, he attributed the victory in large part to his improved shoulder development. Three years later, at the 1970 Universe, he beat his idol Reg Park, and again wrote that he was thankful he’d trained his shoulders so hard.

Joe Weider once asked Arnold what role he thought bone structure played in shoulder development—in other words, were some people born with more potential than others? The future California governor acknowledged that certain individuals possess a genetic advantage (among them, Steve Reeves and Frank Zane), but that doesn’t mean others not so blessed can’t improve greatly in the area. He maintained that anyone could widen his shoulders by at least two inches via “direct and specialized training.”

Training tips
Arnold kept barbell work to a minimum when training shoulders. He reasoned that all the bench and incline presses he did, which also hit the delts to some degree, would suffice.
For a good while, he trained delts first in workouts that also included arms, explaining that his delts were naturally weak and needed to be worked when fresh. You would have been hard-pressed to find Arnold training shoulders in the same workout as chest, as many people do.
Despite the fact that they weren’t often mentioned, the trapezius muscles were never neglected in Arnold’s training. He often worked traps after delts in the same workout.

Legs
In Arnold’s early days, his leg-training protocol suffered from two critical weaknesses: disuse and, as Joe Weider called it, primitivism. The former was pretty straightforward: The young Austrian didn’t train legs at all in his first year of bodybuilding. After finally catching on to the needs of his lower body, he went overboard, even going so far as to train legs every day for a year with 10 sets of squats and 10 sets of leg curls. Not surprisingly, he wasn’t satisfied with the results.

His “primitive” ways were most obvious in the lifting “retreats” he and his buddies would go on in the Austrian countryside. They’d load up several cars with weights (and admiring girls) and drive to a remote area in the trees where they could train. They’d squat from morning till afternoon, rest, party, drink beer, then go right back to squatting again.

When Weider came into the picture, the antiquated training methods went by the wayside, as did the beer-drinking. He felt Arnold’s legs had become bulky and lacked definition. “[Your legs] suffer by comparison [to your upper body] and it is of the most urgent necessity that you completely alter your leg-training program,” Weider told young Arnold. “I rather imagine, too, that others may have noticed this odd effect and are puzzled by it.” Arnold agreed. The result of this rethinking was the type of workout you see here—not to mention the well-proportioned legs that helped him win seven Mr. Olympia titles.

Training tips
Arnold often split his quad workouts into two sessions, doing the first three thigh exercises in the morning and the last one or two in the evening. This assured that every exercise was performed at utmost intensity.
Despite the intensity of his leg training, Arnold usually kept his rest periods between sets short—no more than one minute. This created a “flushing” effect, keeping maximum blood in the muscles for the entire session.
Sometimes he would do leg curls in the middle of his quad workout (after front squats and before leg presses) to give the front of his thighs a short break. Then he’d do more sets of hamstrings at the end of the workout.

Triceps
Though his Alpine-peaked biceps could take much of the credit for his 22″ arms, Arnold was no slouch in the triceps department, either, sporting impressive horseshoes. After initially focusing on bi’s early in his career, he wised up and sought to build hulking triceps by employing multi-joint movements like the close-grip bench press and weighted dip to go along with his old-standbys, pressdowns (on a lat-pulldown machine) and French presses.

Arnold occasionally supersetted biceps and triceps, though usually only during pre-contest training. This further demonstrated his firm belief in the benefits of training opposing muscles together, an idea recognized by Joe Weider before him and many bodybuilders still today. The pre-contest routine typically consisted of five torturous bi/tri supersets repeated four times each, followed by five supersets for forearms. For gains in size, he’d do this twice a week; for definition, three times weekly.

Although he cautioned novice lifters against doing his routine (“This system…is a severe form of advanced training that is not recommended for beginners,” he once said), he did advocate the program to non-beginners in a feature article titled, “How I Built My 22½ -inch Arms.” “If you’re an advanced trainer and want to shock your arms into growth,” he wrote, “why not give my twice-a-week arm-growth program a try? It brought my arms up to their present massive size…see what it can do for you!”

Training tips
Arnold believed that to increase arm size, you had to gain weight. He estimated that it takes a weight gain of about 10lbs to add an inch to the arms. To accomplish this, he would increase his calorie intake by 1,500–2,000 calories a day over his typical diet.
A typical rep for Arnold entailed lowering the weight slowly on the negative and exploding it up on the positive. This gave him a “double benefit on each rep” and promoted maximum growth.
During most of his career, Arnold trained arms two to three days per week with very high volume. He was even known to devote one to two hours to his triceps alone. Of course, conventional training wisdom doesn’t condone this.

Biceps
Inspired by photos of his boyhood idol Reg Park in the German magazine Der Muskelbilder, Arnold made his first visit to a gym as a teenager. The young Oak watched gym-goers lifting weights, and did his best to commit the exercises to memory so he and his friends could do them at home. Four in particular stood out, all arms exercises: the cheating barbell and Zottman curls for biceps, and the pushdown and close-grip bench press for triceps. At the time, having big arms interested him the most, so this served as his starting point.

Surprisingly, when Arnold arrived in America he’d never even seen a preacher bench—an apparatus he’d soon come to use religiously (no pun intended) to build biceps that would surpass those of predecessors Larry Scott and Sergio Oliva. He also discovered that American bodybuilders trained more methodically and had a firmer understanding of anatomy and physiology than he did.

Despite already having a Mr. Universe title and two of the biggest arms in the world, he felt he could do better. “I wasn’t reaching my fullest potential,” he said years later. “The deep fibers of my muscles were untouched. It was as if I had built a large building on top of a foundation of sand.” He recalled watching Scott train and being “particularly fascinated watching him bomb his biceps on a curling machine. His arms looked deep and thick from training.” Despite the freakishly mountainous biceps peak Arnold developed, we can safely say it’s not a tumor.

Training tips
Arnold wasn’t afraid to cheat on arms exercises, especially standing curls. He felt that going very heavy was the best way to gain size, and if a little body English was required to get the weight up, so be it.
To achieve full development, Arnold always included in his routine at least one exercise (such as a dumbbell curl) in which his palm rotated up (supinated) as he lifted the weight.
Even though biceps are a relatively small muscle group, Arnold typically trained them at about the same volume as bigger body parts, and with the heaviest weights he could possibly manage.

Abs
Arnold’s midsection wasn’t his strong suit. He didn’t have a naturally small waist, nor did he possess the deeply etched six-pack of a Frank Zane or a Serge Nubret. But his abs weren’t a glaring weakness, either. Perhaps that was because he was a master of deception. Look at shots of him posing and you’ll notice that he would often twist his upper body in such a way that he’d end up facing the camera or the judges regardless of the pose. This gave him the appearance of having a smaller waist, and was an important strategy for him in competition.

He also defied any genetic shortcomings by adopting an extremely high-volume routine consisting of many exercises and lots of reps. He also acknowledged that eating clean played a major role in minimizing fat in his waist area, which allowed his abs to show through. That his vacuum pose wasn’t quite Zane-like wasn’t for lack of effort or passion. Arnold considered the midsection one of the most critical parts of the male physique, citing the sculpted abdominals of Greek gods as his inspiration. “In physique competitions, if your abdominal region has a slight layer of fatty tissue on it,” he once said, “you might as well forget about taking home a trophy.”

Training tips
Arnold felt that abdominal work should be done every day. He was even known to train abs twice a day when he wanted to make a noticeable difference in a short time.
Arnold’s oblique training consisted primarily of controlled twisting motions while holding a bar across his shoulders. He was careful to avoid weighted oblique crunches, for fear they would build up muscle in that area and make his waistline bigger.
He usually trained abs at the end of his workout, after calves—the other body part he felt needed more frequent training to spur the necessary development.

Calves
Arnold’s self-consciousness about his calves has been well-publicized over the years. They used to be small, so he’d cut the bottoms off his sweatpants while he trained to expose them. This motivated him to improve the area, which he ultimately did by building massive gastroc and soleus muscles. Extreme high-volume and high-training frequency were his keys to bringing up this weak point; but it was even more than that. Arnold seemed to be a bit more cerebral when it came to calf training. Here’s what he had to say in a past issue of Muscle Builder:

“The calves are like no other muscle, and every day they seem to have a different mood. Sometimes I can do calf raises with shoes on and it feels better, then other times the shoes get in the way and I have to do this exercise with bare feet…It’s strange, kind of supernatural.

“A secret I learned is to test the calves’ personality or attitude with two or three sets, then I know which way they want to go that particular day. The calves will let you know—just give them a chance to ‘talk’ to you. [It’s] almost like they have a mind of their own—a brain that the other muscles don’t have.”

Training tips
Arnold loved variety when it came to calf training. Anything that would shock the stubborn calves was fair game: high reps, low reps, super short rest periods (15–30 seconds), supersets, you name it.
For the most part, his calves exercises took the calves through a full range of motion—down for a full stretch, then up till they nearly cramped. But at times he also did full sets of partial reps, which allowed him to go much heavier; or he’d finish off full-range-of-motion sets with a few partials to burn the calves out.
It wasn’t uncommon for Arnold to train calves six days a week in his famous double split training scheme. Calves were typically trained with abs in an afternoon workout, either with quads or on their own.

Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ‘Golden Six’ Routine
When I first started getting into bodybuilding in my teens, my only sources of information were a copy of a bodypart split routine which Arnold Schwarzenegger had used in the mid-70s and the advice of a peer who claimed he could bench press 200kg with one hand.

Unsurprisingly, both of these sources were useless.

My friend couldn’t bench press a salami, let alone 200kg with one hand, and Arnold’s zillion-sets-per-session routine, while no doubt effective for someone juiced to the hilt and possessing above-average genetics, was not the ideal workout for a 15-year-old boy who’s diet primarily comprised Dairylea Dunkers and Jaffa Cakes.

Like many, during my first gym sessions I made the mistake of trying to replicate the high volume routines used by the pros, thinking this would transform me into a cigar chomping, uzi-lubing, truck-lifting monster.

However, this was NOT how Schwarzenegger started out in the gym, nor how he made most of his gains.



Although Arnold is famous for the high-volume body part split routines he outlined in the various Weider publications, when he first ventured into a gym he emulated the training philosophy of his hero and future mentor, Reg Park:

I found out everything I could about Reg Park.

I bought all the magazines that published his programs.

I learned how he started training, what he ate, how he lived, and how he did his workouts.

I became obsessed…

Indeed, the Austrian Oak built his impressive foundation on full-body workouts such as Park’s 5×5 routine and his own ‘Golden Six’ routine which we are going to look at today.

By the 1970s, when Arnold started experimenting with anabolic steroids and had escalated the volume and intensity of his workouts, he had already built an imposing physique on the back of these basic full-body routines.

The Golden Six routine
The ‘Golden Six’ was a programme based around six key exercises that Arnold followed when he started training at a gym in Munich, and, according to the man himself, it was one he made “remarkable” gains on.

This was also the routine which Arnold prescribed for his personal training clients who were looking to “get big”.

Arnold also claimed that Welsh bodybuilder and former Mr World Paul Grant used this exact routine to gain more than 65 pounds of muscle in less than a year!

All he did was gradually increase the number of sets on the first five exercises, moving up to four sets after three months and then six sets after six months

Bear in mind, however, that this is the same Arnold who, in an attempt to land his first movie role, convinced movie producers that he had “done Shakespeare” back in Germany, so take everything he says with a grain of salt.

Notes
Cycle
Arnold recommended performing this routine three times per week on alternating days for a three month cycle.

Progression
Once you can do two to three reps above the recommended amount increase the weight.

Strive to progress wherever possible.

Rest
Rest for two minutes between sets of squats and no more than 90 seconds for the other exercises.

Exercise advice
For Arnold’s comments on each exercise, have a read of this article.

Thoughts
This classic 1950s-1960s style full-body workout is an ideal routine for beginners and ectomorphs looking to bulk up and gain strength.

These kinds of routines – in the vein of Reg Park, John McCallum, Peary Rader etc – are massively under-appreciated these days, which is a shame, because although they’re not fashionable or mainstream any more, they are the perfect way to lay the foundation for a well balanced, muscular physique.

Get in, blitz everything, get out, eat, rest, repeat.

It’s as simple as that.

With regards to exercise selection in this particular routine, I would make a few adjustments, such as adding in some rows or deadlifts (there’s a slight imbalance between push and pull movements here) and replacing the behind-the-neck press with a standard press.

Not only does the former rely on a more unnatural plane of movement which places undue stress on your rotator cuffs, but it is a much harder lift to progress on than the standard press, and adding weight to the bar is the name of the game here

I would also replace the sit-ups with a more efficient ab exercise such as hanging leg raises.

Verdict
If you’re new to the gym and looking for a productive routine to build muscle and size, ditch the dense bodypart splits, isolation exercises and bullshit, and give Arnie’s Golden Six workout a go.

In fact, whatever level of training you’re at, a cycle of this routine will no doubt be extremely productive – provided you’re eating and resting adequately, of course.

It’s simple, enjoyable, effective – and comes with Conan the Barbarian’s seal of approval.

Eating for the Bodybuilding Physique of the 70s

They say we are what we eat. Never a truer word has been spoken and you can look around and pretty much tell who eats right and who doesn’t. I look at today’s society and see obesity all around me starting with the kids right on up to the adults. TV reality shows are all popping up now with those like The Biggest Loser, Jillian Michael’s Losing It and specials on obesity and diabetes.

I don’t remember seeing this much coverage on weight in the 70s as it wasn’t as big a problem then or at least it wasn’t in the media. Today more people are on the run and want to eat quick so they pick those items that are full of sugars and fats and don’t stop to analyze what’s in it and what it will do to them. Some gain 100 lbs in no time and don’t even realize it until it’s there. Then they’re on to their 2nd 100 lbs.

When I was in school, we had cafeterias that took pride in their meals and were cooked by little old ladies in the back. Each meal was balanced and came with a lot of flavor as well. Today’s schools package meals and stick them in vending machines for the kids. It’s a no thought process.

I started my bodybuilding physique diet for the 70s diet in the 60s so you might say I was ahead of my time. But, I got most my information out of reading muscle magazines, which the average person would never read and even laugh at me for doing it. These articles began my structure to eat right and get results in my body.

The main diet for a bodybuilding physique in the 70s was high protein and low carb. It was Protein to build the muscle and less carb to reduce body fat. It made perfect sense to me and the others that trained. However when you would try to explain this to someone on the street, it would be an argument about how they liked to eat all the other foods. This wasn’t a case of like or dislike, but we would eat for results even if we didn’t like the food.

Rheo H. Blair theory
This diet started way back maybe even beyond the 50s but I do remember in 1967 many of the bodybuilders on the beach drinking quart containers of extra rich milk or even cream. Some would go to restaurants and drink the cream right out of the containers on the tables. This was pretty extreme but they did it. The reason for this was of course the extra protein and the fat content for energy, which I’ll get into later in this article.

Supplements were just breaking ground around then and the main things to take were liver pills that were extreme in building stomach gases and Soy protein, which really didn’t work that well. Some of us would add powdered milk to our regular milk just to get more protein. I would also see protein cans on the shelves in stores but the spelling was PROTEEN. I was never sure what was in that so I didn’t try it. But, I did use dehydrated fish powder as it was considered pure protein. I wasn’t easily digested and tasted like vomit but it did have its value.

We depended most on ‘real’ foods such as the diet below and this was very basic.

Breakfast – Beef patty and 3 eggs, cottage cheese and vitamins.

Lunch – Chicken or Fish, or Beef patty, small salad, option eggs and cottage cheese. Or Tuna.

Mid afternoon snack – Can of Tuna or chicken breasts or protein drink.

Dinner -Steak, or Chicken with small salad, cottage cheese and sugar free jello and vegetables.

Bedtime – Cheese omelet

This was considered high protein, low carbohydrate and the fats came from eggs and cheese and for some of the other people, extra rich milk or cream. In fact we were supposed to mix our protein with cream which was the Rheo H. Blair theory.

Rheo had his own supplements which were expensive but were deemed to get results for bodybuilders like Larry Scott and Don Howarth to name a couple.

Eat for Energy
Fats were used to burn as energy in the gym and would not be stored on the body as fat whereas carbohydrates are stored as fat and burned later. You would need a certain amount of calories to burn and the fat would increase those. But, going without carbs for long periods of time can deplete your body and your brain and can make you very angry.

You do need some sugar and one day a week it was ok to go off the diet and have a junk day. This day to many was usually Sundays were we could eat anything we wanted all day long. The belief in that was you cannot get fat in one day. Everything you eat will pass right through and not stick, but it will retain water so by Monday you could be up in weight 5 lbs. or more and back to normal by Wednesday.

We always looked forward to Sundays, as many of us would down whole pizzas, half gallons of ice cream, cookies, cheesecakes, spaghetti and meatballs and just about any sugar we could find. I even went as far as to suck out the cookie crumbs from the empty box. It was an uncontrollable craving that was not really healthy at all.

I remember crawling away from the dinner table at night so bloated that I could hardly walk. This was the case of many but then right back on the diet the next day.

Many of us would eat at ‘smorgys’, all you can eat places in fact the sign said, “all you can eat.” We’d eat as much as 12 pieces of chicken in one sitting just to get the protein. Some of the guys would bring in their gym bags and tin foil and sneak out another dozen chicken breasts for later. Soon the management was losing money and discouraged all bodybuilders from coming in and changed the sign to ‘the best you can eat.”

In today’s world we are asked to watch our fats because of heart and artery problems and cholesterol build up. This makes a lot of sense and I do believe that everything should be done in moderation.

Fad Diets
Fad diets came along later in the 70s like the Atkin’s diet, Zone diet which were complete knockoffs of our bodybuilding diet. I tried to explain this diet to several people back then but they felt more convinced by reading about it when it became the Aitkin’s diet. I guess they didn’t think that we as bodybuilders knew much.

I think some of the biggest issues with this diet were mood swings from feeling starved from carbohydrates and also elimination because of the high protein and no bulk. The mood swings could be reversed by a little sugar and the elimination was balanced out by taking a form of fiber at least once to twice a day.

On a diet like this, you can get very lean and muscular in a short period of time but, if you reverse it and go back to eating carbs, your body will tend to get heavy and blow up way beyond where you were when you started. Fat cells don’t disappear, but instead shrink in size, so when you feed them again, they blow up to original size and bigger.

I’ve found that over the years, it’s best to do this in moderation. No more junk days but instead a little carbs every few days. I don’t get fat and can stay hard plus keep my sanity as well. I don’t eat a lot and space my meals just as I did back then. If I feel a pound or two start to come on, then I’ll cut back even more but always try to maintain where I look good in the mirror. The scale doesn’t tell the truth, because you can lose weight and still look fat, but the mirror doesn’t lie.
